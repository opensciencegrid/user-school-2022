<p style="font-size: larger; font-weight: bold;">Could you transform your research with vast amounts of computing?</p>

*Learn how during a week this summer at the lovely [University of Wisconsin–Madison](https://wisc.edu/)*

During the School,
July 25–29,
you will learn to use [high-throughput computing](https://htcondor.org/htc.html) (HTC) systems —
at your own campus or using the national-scale [OSG](https://osg-htc.org/) —
to run large-scale computing applications that are at the heart of today’s cutting-edge science.

Through lectures, discussions, and **lots of hands-on activities** with experienced OSG staff,
you will learn how HTC systems work,
how to run and manage lots of jobs and huge datasets to implement a scientific computing workflow,
and where to turn for more information and help.

The school is ideal for graduate students in any research area
for which large-scale computing is a vital part of the research process,
plus we welcome applications from advanced undergraduates, post-doctoral students, faculty, and staff
(especially staff who perform research or support/facilitate researchers).

People accepted to this program will receive financial support for
basic travel and local costs associated with the School.

## Applications

Applications are now closed for 2022.
The deadline for applications was Monday, 18 April 2022.

If still needed,
have someone email a letter of recommendation for you to
[user-school@opensciencegrid.org](mailto:user-school@opensciencegrid.org)
(any reasonable format is fine; we like PDF or plain text best)

For the letter of recommendation, ask someone who knows you professionally&nbsp;&mdash;
ideally a faculty member or other supervisor.
They should clearly identify your name and the “OSG User School 2022” in the subject line and letter,
so that we can associate your application and letter.

**Applicants:**
We plan to review applications by late April and invite participants by early May or so.
Once decisions have been made,
we will notify you using the email address you put in the application.
Thank you for your patience!
